# PYDSA

> Python Data Structures and Algorithms (PYDSA) is a collection of my own solutions with time and space complexity analysis of practical algorithms and data structures.

## Built With

- Python 3x
- Creativity, persistence and patience.

## Live Demo

There isn't a live demo for this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3x installed.

### Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa.git
$ cd pydsa
```

### Run tests

Each algorithm has its own directory and its unit tests are provided from within that directory.

For instance, running the tests for `active_directory.py`:

```bash
$ python active_directory/active_directory.py
True
True
True
True
```

Adding a test framework like `unittest` or `pytest` is something that'll be added in the future.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created with the purpose to submit my project for Part II of Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree, Show Me The Data Structures. Going forward, I'll be including my solutions to algorithms that I find of practical use, using the same format.
