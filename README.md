# PYDSA

PYDSA is an acronym for Python Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository is a collection of my own solutions with time and space complexity analysis of problems found online. It was initially created with the purpose to submit my project for Part II of Udacity's Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree, *Show Me The Data Structures*. The course can be found [here]().

Going forward, I'll be including problems with a practical use case and that I've personally found very entertaining. All problems will attempt to follow the same structure: solution and explanation of the choice made on data structures used and a time/space complexity analysis.

## Problems

The following problems are in this repository:

Name|Description|Link
---|---|---
Active Directory|Provide an efficient lookup of whether a user is in a group. A group could consist of both user(s) and group(s).|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/active_directory)|
Blockchain|This is a basic blockchain implementation using a Block class and a Chain class.|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/blockchain)
Find Files|Find all files with a specific `suffix` under a target directory|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/find_files)
Huffman Coding|"[...] Type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding [...]" - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/huffman_coding)
LRU Cache|LRU Cache implementation of get and set operations in constant time `O(1)`|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/lru_cache)
Union Intersection|Union and intersection method to be used on a `LinkedList`|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/union_intersection)
