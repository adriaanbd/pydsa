## Problems

The following problems are in this repository:

Name|Description|Link
---|---|---
Active Directory|Provide an efficient lookup of whether a user is in a group. A group could consist of both user(s) and group(s).|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/active_directory)|
Blockchain|This is a basic blockchain implementation using a Block class and a Chain class.|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/blockchain)
Find Files|Find all files with a specific `suffix` under a target directory|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/find_files)
Huffman Coding|"[...] Type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding [...]" - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/huffman_coding)
LRU Cache|LRU Cache implementation of get and set operations in constant time `O(1)`|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/lru_cache)
Union Intersection|Union and intersection method to be used on a `LinkedList`|See [here](https://github.com/adriaanbd/pydsa/tree/master/union_intersection)
